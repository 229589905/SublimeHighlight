SublimeHighlight
================

This [SublimeText2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) package allows to highlight &
export currently edited code to HTML or RTF using [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

Several commands are added to SublimeText2 when installed:

- **SublimeHighlight: convert to HTML**
- **SublimeHighlight: convert to RTF**
- **SublimeHighlight: view as HTML**
- **SublimeHighlight: view as RTF**
- **SublimeHighlight: copy to clipboard as HTML**
- **SublimeHighlight: copy to clipboard as RTF**

Why this package?
-----------------

Mostly for toying around with [SublimeText2 plugin API](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/api_reference.html)
(which is great), but also to ease the process of copying/pasting richly
formatted code over softwares like Powerpoint, Word, Keynote and shits like
that.
